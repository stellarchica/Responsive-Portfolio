                    She is currently the digital content editor at the <i><a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/" target="_blank">San Antonio Current</a></i>, the Alamo City's alt-weekly.
                    Her work has appeared in publications such as <i>BUST Magazine</i>'s website, We Are Mitu, (the now-defunct) SWTST.co, and Sexually Redefined.
                    In her job at the <i>Current</i>, Sarah enjoys writing about all things "puro" San Antonio, food and social justice issues related to the LGBT community and undocumented families.

                <p>
                    After completing coding bootcamp, Sarah hopes to utilize her new-found skills and find a job as a front-end developer.
